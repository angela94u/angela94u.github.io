<p> This is alittle about me and mostly about some of my favorite artists </p>

Hi I'm Angela. Iâ€™m currently 17, about to be 18 on October 2. I am a rising senior. Hearing music is one of my favorite
things to do becuase it keeps me calm and this year I was able to see some of my favorite artists live
including Tory Lanez, the Weeknd, Cardi B, Shawn Mendes, and A Boogie wit da hoodie:)
Seeing your favorite artists live is a completely different exprience even though I was pretty far away for some.
Random but this is my favorite store to shop--->
